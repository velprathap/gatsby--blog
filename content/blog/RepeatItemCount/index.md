In this article, we are going to learn about the method to calculate the repeated words count in the given array.

Repetition count calculation method.

```js
const getRepeatedWordDetails = (inputArray) => {
    // extract the unique items
    const uniqueItems = [...new Set(inputArray)];
    const repetationObj = {};
    // repetation item count calculation
    uniqueItems.forEach(item => {
        const filtereItem = inputArray.filter(word => word === item);
        repetationObj[item] = filtereItem.length;
    });
    return repetationObj;
}
```

Count from Array of Strings

```js
const stringArray = ["react", "js", "react", "angular", "react", "js"];

getRepeatedWordDetails(stringArray);
```

Output

```js
{react: 3, js: 2, angular: 1}
```

Count from Array of Integers

```js
const arr2 = [10, 20, 20, 30, 10, 20, 30];

getRepeatedWordDetails(arr2);
```

Output
```js
{10: 2, 20: 3, 30: 2}
```

That's it for this post friends. I have tried to in this way, if you guys have any other idea share with me will attempt to learn together.
